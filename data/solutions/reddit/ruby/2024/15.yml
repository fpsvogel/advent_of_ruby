    I hate debugging recursion so I didn't do that. Part 2 horizontal movement is pretty close to part 1. For part 2 vertical movement I deployed the ol' "implement how you would solve this manually strategy" and it worked very well with minimal debugging needed. A quick BFS to get all the boxes that will be shuffled (this also checks whether there is any wall blocking them) and then simply shift the boxes up/down. Ended up accidentally breaking the logic when I was refactoring tho, silly me

    This was my 250th stars all events together! I will probably put a pause on the remaining 10 days until the new year and just enjoy my travel now

    Not proud of what i wrote cuz it's alot, but part 2 is almost the same as part1, only really needed a special looping condition for the up and downs since overlapping between 2 indices is only possible there, while left and right movement is irrelevant since we can treat [, and] the same as O in horizontal movement

    The logic for part 2 came to me immediately, but I probably burned 20 minutes on part 2 scoring because I misinterpreted it as edge of the box to the closest edge of the map.
