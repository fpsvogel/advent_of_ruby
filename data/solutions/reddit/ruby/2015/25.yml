    First time on the leaderboard (#62)! I was able to come up with a formula for how many times to apply the multiplication and remainder and then just repeated the steps that many times.

    Ruby:

    ```ruby
    row = 2947
    column = 3029
    n = row + column - 2
    iterations = (n * (n + 1)) / 2 + column - 1
    result = 20151125
    iterations.times do
      result = (result * 252533) % 33554393
    end

    puts "Value at (#{row}, #{column}): #{result}"
    ```

      :body: I intend to release a much more thorough set of completion data; this leaderboard won't be the only one.

    **Ruby #36 - 10:50**

    Pretty simple one overall, but I'm happy it ended on a quick one rather than one of the knock-down, drag-out ones that took an hour or more to complete.

    ```ruby
    end_row = 2981
    end_col = 3075
    row = 1
    col = 1
    max_row = 1
    acc = 20151125
    until row == end_row && col == end_col
      acc = (acc * 252533) % 33554393
      if max_row == col
        row = max_row + 1
        max_row = row
        col = 1
      else
        row -= 1
        col += 1
      end
    end

    p acc
    ```

    Going to throw a donation to /u/topaz2078 when I have money in my paypal account. Enjoyed going through these and will use some of them as practice for learning new languages. Enjoyed learning from all of you here, as well, by looking through your code and reading your comments/suggestions on mine. Merry Christmas!!

    Ruby, this day felt as the easiest in a long time. Thanks for Advent of Code, it was great!

    ```ruby
    def index(x,y)

        y_value = loop(y,1,1)
        x_value = loop(x,y_value,(y+1))
    end

    def loop(target, start, start_step)
    current = start
        for i in (1...target)
            current += (i + (start_step -1))
        end
        current
    end

    index_of_answer = index(3083,2978)
    #index_of_answer = index(6,6)
    last_answer = 20151125
    index_of_answer.times do |i|
        next if (i == 0)
        puts "#{i}/#{index_of_answer}" if (i% 1000 == 0)
        last_answer = ((last_answer * 252533) %33554393)
    end
    puts last_answer
    ```
