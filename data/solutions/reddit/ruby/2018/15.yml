    [Ruby]

    Before solving it, I even tried some Python solutions from here and they return wrong answers for my input. Here is my code, hope it helps somebody :) -\> [https://gist.github.com/leio10/6a73c9380348a2ff57d54185d1d40d25](https://gist.github.com/leio10/6a73c9380348a2ff57d54185d1d40d25)

    My biggest problem was that I was considering the _reading order_ when choosing the next step for moving, but not doing it to choose the target adjacent square. I even passed the part 1 with this error, but not the part 2. I finally fixed adding the target to array in [https://gist.github.com/leio10/6a73c9380348a2ff57d54185d1d40d25#file-aoc-day15-rb-L85](https://gist.github.com/leio10/6a73c9380348a2ff57d54185d1d40d25#file-aoc-day15-rb-L85)

    This took me a while, and my solution in **Ruby** is a bit verbose - but I tried to make it easy to follow (at least for myself) to minimize mistakes.
