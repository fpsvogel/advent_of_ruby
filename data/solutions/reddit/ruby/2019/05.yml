      > had a real tough time with this one due to unclear requirements on how position modes would or would not be provided.

      Man, I'm glad I'm not alone here! I'm working through this one now, also in Ruby, and this is the first day where the instructions left me totally puzzled

      :body: I actually just realized I still had a bug in this due to position modes in my OutputOp. Instructions definitely were not clear on this, but I think the rule is basically "Everything except Input might provide position modes"

            Do you mean, what does 'Input' and 'Output' mean? I didn't understand that either. Input means ask the user for input (i.e. `gets`) and output means print it to the user (i.e. `puts`). So if the Input command looks like this:

            `3 55`

            That means ask the user for input and store the number they type in at position 55

    # RUBY

    Took me a while to realize that the 'input' was actually coming from `stdin` and not from the puzzle, but once i got that the rest came kinda easy.

    Part 2 I just had to fiddle with until I got the instruction pointer correct.
