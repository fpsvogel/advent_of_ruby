    My Intcode machine interface has been set up for this sort of thing since day 7; it seems to have worked out pretty nicely here. If my intcode machines I had explicit input queues instead of the provide\_input code which lets external code manage provision of input, the non-blocking inputs would have been somewhat more awkward to handle.

    (As you can see, the machines do have output queues; the way this works is that on startup or after receiving any input, the machine proceeds as far as it can, putting up any output generated into its output queue; this stops when it either halts or blocks waiting for external code to provide another input.)
