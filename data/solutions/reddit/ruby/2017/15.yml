    Ruby; I'm stupid. I wrote `65535`, thought to myself wait am I right? rewrote it to `1<< ... -1`, ran it, oh yeah it's `65536`, then I freaking went to change it back to 65535 because I **totally have that kind of time**. (silver 101 / gold 60)

    anyway... you've gotta be good at manipulating with bits, right? :D

    ```ruby
    f=16807
    g=48271
    h=2147483647
    j=65535
    i=0
    a=gets[/\d+$/].to_i
    b=gets[/\d+$/].to_i
    40000000.times{ # part 1
    5000000.times{ # part 2
    loop{a=a*f%h # part 1: only keep this
    break if a%4<1}
    loop{b=b*g%h # part 1: only keep this
    break if b%8<1}
    i+=1 if 0== (a&j)^(b&j)
    }
    p i
    ```

    **ruby**

    that postfix until is nice, i didn't even know that was possible...

    ```ruby
    VALUES = [873,583]
    FACTORS = [16807,48271]
    DENUM = 2147483647

    def part_1
      matches = 0
      values = VALUES.clone

      40000000.times do
        values[0] = values[0] * FACTORS[0] % DENUM
        values[1] = values[1] * FACTORS[1] % DENUM

        matches += 1 if values[0] & 65535 == values[1] & 65535
      end

      puts matches
    end

    def part_2
      matches = 0
      values = VALUES.clone

      5000000.times do
        values[0] = values[0] * FACTORS[0] % DENUM
        values[1] = values[1] * FACTORS[1] % DENUM

        values[0] = values[0] * FACTORS[0] % DENUM until values[0] % 4 == 0
        values[1] = values[1] * FACTORS[1] % DENUM until values[1] % 8 == 0

        matches += 1 if values[0] & 65535 == values[1] & 65535
      end

      puts matches
    end
    ```
