    Ruby, #8 silver #4 gold (run with -x)

    ```ruby
    To ensure security, a valid passphrase must contain no duplicate words.

    For added security, yet another system policy has been put in place. Now, a valid passphrase must contain no two words that are anagrams of each other - that is, a passphrase is invalid if any words letters can be rearranged to form any other word in the passphrase.

    For example:

    abcde fghij is a valid passphrase.
    abcde xyz ecdab is not valid - the letters from the third word can be rearranged to form the first word.
    a ab abc abd abf abj is a valid passphrase, because all letters need to be used when forming another word.
    iiii oiii ooii oooi oooo is valid.
    oiii ioii iioi iiio is not valid - any of these words can be rearranged to form any other word.

    #!ruby
    p $<.count{|x|v=x.split
    v=v.map!{|x|x.chars.sort*''} # this line added for part 2
    v.uniq==v}
    ```

    PS: I now keep a [log series detailing my adventofcode adventure](https://github.com/Unihedro/workout/blob/master/adventofcode2017/entry1.md). If you're interested feel free to read it as I write more, if I do!

    :body: Fun log series! It's always enlightening to see some stream-of-consciousness gut-reaction to the puzzles so I can try to improve them for next year.

    Never code golfed before, but I gave it a try:

    ```ruby
    #!/usr/bin/ruby
    # part 1
    p File.read('data.txt').split("\n").count{|p|a=p.split;a==a.uniq}
    # part 2
    p File.read('data.txt').split("\n").count{|p|a=p.split.map{|w|w.chars.sort};a==a.uniq}
    ```

      You can trim some characters using `readlines()`. No need for a `split()` anymore:

      `p File.readlines('data.txt').count{|p|a=p.split;a==a.uniq}`
