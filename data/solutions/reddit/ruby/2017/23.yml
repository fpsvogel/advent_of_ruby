    Ruby; rank 80 for part 2. Ruby has continuation (like goto but only backflip) so it made porting the code easier. I actually converted the code pretty quick, but it took a lot of staring to realize what it was actually doing... I blame the lack of sleep!

    For fun, unoptimized version: https://gist.github.com/Unihedro/962b3c66f0ed500cb66530fd9b775bb9

    ```ruby
    require'continuation'
    d=e=f=g=h=0
    c=b=93
    b*=100
    b+=100000
    c=b
    c+=17000
    j2 = callcc {|cc| cc}
    p h+=1 if (2...(b**0.5).to_i).any?{|d|
    b%d==0
    }
    g=b
    g-=c
    (p h;exit)if g==0
    b+=17
    j2.call(j2)
    ```
