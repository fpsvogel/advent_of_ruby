    I had a blast today. This summer, I had a lecture on flow algorithms, which included an algorithm for finding a minimum cut. So, I took this opportunity to revise my knowledge and implement a flow algorithm for the first time.

    For those who know flow algorithms, I used a variation of the preflow-push algorithm to find a a-b cut, then a {a, b}-c cut, then a {a, b, c}-d cut etc. The minimum cut is then guaranteed to be the smallest of these cuts.

    The code can be found [in my github](https://github.com/Kateba72/advent_of_code/blob/main/aoc/y2023/d25.rb), it should run in O(nÂ² + nm) (where n is the number of vertices and m the number of edges). For the input, it runs in ~46ms on my machine
